# Package utils.mapBased.keys


Contains delegates that define logic for property 
value retrieval from a map.

The goal of this package is to provide property delegates that
work in a similar way to delegation by a map object. However, unlike
maps these delegates allow the user to set more complex strategies for
setting/retrieving property values.

For more information on how the delegates interact with the map, see 
[MapInterface].
